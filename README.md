## Advent of Code 2020

Check out the challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)!

An attempt to challenge myself to get through Advent of Code 2020!

### **Day 1**

**Part 1** <br>
Utilized nested loops to get through the array puzzle and using if statement to console.log the 2 array elements that sums up to 2020 and the multiplication of the two elements, which is the answer for the puzzle! <br>

**Part 2** <br>
Tried to use 3 layer of nested loop and timed out in trying to execute the program. Definitely not a good idea! Utilized `.forEach` to mimic the first iteration of nested loop and using 2 layer nested loop to return the multiplication of the 3 elements. 


Day 1 **Completed**!
